**Vision Trainer** is a high-fidelity, privacy-first **Teachable Machine Clone**. It allows users to create, train, and test custom image recognition models in real-time using nothing but their webcam and browser. No servers, no uploads, just pure intelligence.

</div>

## 🚀 Key Highlights

*   �️ **100% Privacy:** All images are processed locally. Your data never touches any server.
*   ⚡ **Ultra-Fast Training:** Uses **MobileNet V1 (Transfer Learning)** for near-instant model creation.
*   📸 **Burst Capture:** Advanced data collection with "Hold to Record" functionality.
*   � **Neural Portability:** Export your trained "Brain" as a JSON file and import it anytime.
*   ✨ **Dark Glassmorphism UI:** Sophisticated dark theme with stunning animations.

## 🛠️ The Tech Engine

Vision Trainer is built on a modern, high-performance stack:

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Next.js 15+** | Robust frontend architecture |
| **TensorFlow.js** | Client-side hardware-accelerated ML |
| **MobileNet V1** | Pre-trained feature extractor for rapid learning |
| **Framer Motion** | Fluid, cinematic UI transitions |
| **Zustand** | Lightning-fast global state management |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Precision modern styling |

## � How It Works

### Step 1: Collect Data 📸
Create your classes (e.g., "Empty Room", "Phone", "Notebook"). Use our **Burst Mode** to capture dozens of angles in seconds.

### Step 2: Supercharged Training 🧠
Hit the "Start Training" button. Our engine uses **KNN Classification** to map the visual patterns of your images to the pre-loaded MobileNet model.

### Step 3: Real-Time Prediction 💡
Once trained, the live preview immediately starts predicting. Watch the confidence bars shift as you move objects in front of the lens.

### Step 4: Share & Export 📤
Download your model weights. You can reload this model later using the **Import** feature to skip training entirely.
